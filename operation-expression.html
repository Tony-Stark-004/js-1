    <h1>Add two Numbers</h1>
    <p>You are provided with two numbers A and B. Your task is to add these two numbers.</p>
    <pre class="que-code">const AddTwoNumbers = (a,b) => {
      return a + b;

   </pre>

   <h1>Find if the conditions are obeyed or not?</h1>
    <p>You are given two number first as A and second as B and check if both conditions (A<10 and A>B) are satisfied 
      or not with the help of operators.Note: You have to complete Is_Valid function. No need to take any input.</p>
    <pre class="que-code">const Is_Valid = (a,b) => {
      if(a<10 && a>b) {
        return true;
      }

    <h1>Check the conditons</h1>
    <p>You are given two numbers A and B. You need to do the following checks:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>if both are divisible by 10 console true.</li>
      <li>if both are not divisible by 10 console false.</li>
      <li>if one of them only is divisible by 10 console true. Use operator to do this.</li>
    </ul>

     <pre class="que-code">const Check = (A, B) => 
      {
         if(A%10 === 0 && B%10 === 0) {
